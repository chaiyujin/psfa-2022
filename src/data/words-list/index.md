## Sentences

> The [**Harvard sentences**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_sentences), sometimes called **Harvard lines**,<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_sentences#cite_note-vox-20210803-1)</sup> are a collection of sample phrases that are used for standardized testing of [Voice over IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_over_IP), [cellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phone), and other [telephone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone) systems. They are **phonetically balanced** sentences that use specific phonemes at the same frequency they appear in English.

## Words

In **Speech Audiometry**, there are [different types of speech stimuli](https://baslpcourse.com/different-types-of-stimuli-used-in-speech-audiometry/).

### Spondaic Words

* Spondee (or spondaic) words, which are two-syllable words that have equal emphasis on both syllables, such as “baseball” or “railroad.”
* Lists of spondaic words for assessing hearing loss for speech were first developed at the Harvard Psychoacoustic Laboratories (PAL) by Hudgins
  et al. (1947).

### Monosyllabic Words

* The most commonly used materials for clinical speech recognition testing are monosyllabic words that are presented in an open-set format.

* Monosyllabic words are those which cannot be separated into two or more syllables. Each syllable has to contain no less than one consonant and one vowel, or only a vowel. For example – Cat, Rat, Hat etc.

* Historically, word lists such as:

  * [The Phonetically Balanced 50 (PB-50; Egan, 1948)](./words-PAL-PB50.md)
  * [The CID Auditory Test W-22 (CID W-22; Hirsh et al., 1952)](./words-CID-W-22.md)
  * [Maryland CNC List (1, 3, 6, 7, 9, 10 from original CNC List)](./words-Maryland-CNC.md)
  * [The Northwestern University Auditory Test No. 6](./words-NU-6.md)

  have been used to assess word recognition performance in a quiet background during audiologic evaluations.
